reorganize stuff.

Figure out where I left off

Currently, everything requires manual operation.

Execution order to get everything to work:
ID_finder.ipynb generates 'affiliates annual links' which is used in 'Form_990_Data_gather' to generate a dataframe of IRS990 data.

Don't do that though! The file 'affiliate_data.csv' contains the final output.

Or is it 'dataframe.csv' ??

Or is it 'excel_affiliate_dataframe' ??? Ah, why did I make this so confusing on myself.

But there is no need to rerun anything!

Also you won't be able to run 'ID_finder.ipynb' unless you change the code to download the necessary index files before hand.


Need to rename 'affiliates annual links' file to better follow best practices...

need to transition to .py files.


Refresh myself on what tools exist to best handle IRS990 data...



Backup Python Scripts is missing some older things... I think...

Was I working on something to shorten key names? Why was I doing that?
